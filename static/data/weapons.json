With the combination of thick arboreal environment, swarm tactics of the Egregorians, and ineffectual performance of slug ammunition, the need for a recession on the ban was apparent. The Krakatoa was quickly developed and affiliate patterns disseminated. Adopted by Union MEF units, the Krakatoa saw heavy use in the deep world-jungle of Hercynia and towering hives of the Egregorians thanks to its stability, intensity, and stopping power — a necessary feature competitor makes lacked. Egregorian drones and warriors, commanded by their overminds, would not stop advancing until they were physically incapable of doing so — the force at which the Krakatoa expelled flame and fuel was sufficient to knock back or otherwise incapacitate charging warriors on the periphery of the flame cone. Reworked after the cessation of the Hercynian crisis, the Krakatoa is now a popular tool for creating area-of-denial firebreaks. It's legality is currently under review by the Galactic Treaties Board.",

Where the contents of that bubble go is unknown, but the effect is dramatic: anything inside the projected bubble simply ceases to exist in this dimension, transported somewhere else in the void of blinkspace. The Displacer makes no sound when fired, but the sudden and necessary venting of its power supply is tremendous; similarly, the heat wave of its backblast is deadly to any unshielded personnel exposed to it.",

The HA SOL-pattern laser rifle is capable of a 3.5PW maximum output, pulsed, but can project a beam at lower power levels; additionally, while some laser rifles can double as communication/data transfer devices, the Armory‘s SOL is strictly tuned for combat, and has no such communication capability. The SOL is a solid state and entirely self-contained, but can be patched into a chassis‘ reactor core for operation and to re-charge spent weaponry. Energy weapons, while having downsides of their own, are commonly used in micro-and-zero-gravity environments due to having no impulse or kinetic user feedback.",

These particles are impossible to see through optical/visible means: as they travel faster than light, they cannot be seen or avoided intentionally.
