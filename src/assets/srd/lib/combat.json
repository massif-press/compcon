Some groups prefer a game focused more on roleplaying and politics, in which most conflicts are decided with skill checks.</p> <p>That said, lancers have a particular talent, and it&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s bound to come up during missions: fighting in mechs. Even if you&rsquo;re playing a more narrative game, there are times you&rsquo;ll find that you want combat to be more tactical, and for each decision to matter more; you&rsquo;ll want to test out your ingenuity, and put your mech-building and fighting skills to good use. That&rsquo;s the signal that it&rsquo;s time for mech combat. Unlike narrative play, mech combat is <strong>tactical and turn-based</strong>.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s also primarily about mechs &ndash; you can certainly use the mech combat rules for fights between pilots, but the options are far less interesting. There are a couple of key differences between using the mech combat rules to play out combat and playing it out narratively:</p> <p>In mech combat, instead of using triggers and skill checks to determine the outcome of conflicts, you use<strong> attack rolls, mech skill checks, and saves</strong>. Players take turns, and during their turns have access to specific types of actions.</p> <p>The <strong>stakes</strong> of mech combat are much higher, and the scale much larger. Whatever other skills your pilot has, it&rsquo;s only their experience fighting in a mech that will help them succeed. Instead of getting bonuses from triggers, a pilot&rsquo;s GRIT determines their bonuses for attack rolls and saves.</p>"

For example, in a massive pitched battle, spaces might be 50 feet on each side.</p> <p>All characters and objects have a <strong>SIZE</strong> statistic, which describes their physical presence on the battlefield and how many spaces they occupy. A <strong>SIZE 1</strong> character occupies 1 space on all sides and is 1 space high, while a <strong>SIZE 3</strong> character occupies 3 spaces on all sides and is 3 spaces high. Most characters and objects range between <strong>SIZE 1</strong> and <strong>SIZE 3</strong>.</p> <p><strong>SIZE</strong> doesn&rsquo;t always represent a precise height and width &ndash; it describes an area of influence.

Pilots, for instance, are <strong>SIZE 1/2</strong>, while mechs can go up to <strong>SIZE 3</strong> and beyond. When measuring spaces, anything smaller than <strong>SIZE 1</strong> is rounded up.
