Enter the Raleigh, a stylistic and design oddity for IPS-N. Designed not as a specialist, but as a purpose-built, close-range mech, the Raleigh failed to stun potential clients in trials.<br>Though a favorite of test pilots due to its unique styling and agility, the Raleigh saw few fleet orders and, after a brief run as IPS-N’s flagship, was quietly rolled back and replaced with the Tortuga. No longer offered as a fleet contract, the Raleigh enjoys a quiet popularity among pilots seeking a well-balanced, if close-ranged, line mech.",

The Mjolnir is a hard-mounted, multi-barrel auxiliary cannon that uses magnetic acceleration to fire stacks of airburst projectiles at its target. It’s an impulse weapon, tied to the pilot’s second-tier neural processes with mediation from a COMP/CON or NHP; even in death, a pilot’s Mjolnir will continue to identify and attack hostile targets until reaching total systemic failure. For this reason, the Mjolnir is often referred to as a deadgun – one of many such weapons to be found among CQB-oriented pilots.",

For the rest of the scene, you load two rounds into chambers at the end of any of your turns in which you haven’t fired the M35 Mjolnir . It can hold a maximum of six rounds.<br>When you fire the M35 Mjolnir, all chambers fire simultaneously, dealing 4 kinetic damage per loaded round. If you fire four or more rounds at once, the attack gains AP and, on a hit, your target becomes Shredded until the end of their next turn.",

A broad classification, the T-3 range includes conventional-kinetic anti-materiel rifles, super-rapid cycling pulse rifles, missile racks, cannons, and drone nexuses – “hive” style launchers that serve as miniature factory, hangar, and deployment systems for portable drones.
