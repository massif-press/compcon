Use your mech's Heavy Charged Blade to deal armor-piercing melee damage, which can attack an additional enemy if it hits, thanks to Executioner. Find or establish choke points to lock down your surroundings with your Threat 3 Shotgun and the Vanguard’s namesake talent, which confers Accuracy on every attack within the weapon's threat. Don’t hesitate to use the Hex Charges when confronted with clustered enemies at midrange, especially due to its degree of guaranteed damage. Combined Arms, as well as your Projected Shield, allows you to synergize with and support allies with similar close-combat profiles.",
