2gob4nhp,If you are asking how many nhps can fit in a goblin the answer is always yes.
2gob4nhp,I really don't see the point of defensive mechs. If you can cap that ass before they can twitch a finger than you no longer have a defense problem. My friend’s brother use to pilot a Drake and that thing could take a beating and keep on ticking and I guess the Assault Cannon is cool and all and can turn smaller mechs into swiss cheese in the time it takes to say “darn”. But come on man, you take a big enough hit and you are gonna be down for the count. I am talking the kind of hit that RA would wince at. The kind of hit that was felt back in 4998u when a Caliban pilot threw an elite assault mech 20km off a cliff in the Hell in the Cell operation.

Mild-Lesbian,What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you script kiddie? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the HORUS coding academy, and I've been involved in numerous cyber attacks on Harrison Armory, and I have over 300 confirmed server crashes. I am trained in cyber warfare and I'm the top hacker in the entire Alpha Quadrant. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe your hard drive the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before in this galaxy, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Omninet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of shitposters across the cluster and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, Beta. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking cancelled, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can DDOS in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in VR combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Omninet and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the Universe, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.

I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the HORUS coding academy, and I've been involved in numerous cyber attacks on Harrison Armory, and I have over 300 confirmed server crashes. I am trained in cyber warfare and I'm the top hacker in the entire Alpha Quadrant. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe your hard drive the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before in this galaxy, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Omninet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of shitposters across the cluster and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, Beta. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking cancelled, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can DDOS in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in VR combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Omninet and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the Universe, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
